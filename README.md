# General Description

üß† Autonomous Vehicle Solution ‚Äì WRO 2025 Future Engineers Category


This repository contains the code and technical documentation of an autonomous vehicle designed for the **WRO 2025 ‚Äì Future Engineers** category. The vehicle is built using an **Arduino Uno**, a **Motor Shield**, **three ultrasonic sensors**, and a **servo motor** for directional control.

The robot is programmed to navigate autonomously through a predefined course. It can detect and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors, perform directional corrections via a servo motor, and make intelligent decisions based on distance thresholds. The entire system is designed to run efficiently with simple components and logic, demonstrating robust obstacle management and movement coordination.

‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components

* **Arduino Uno** ‚Äì Main microcontroller.
* **Motor Shield (HW-130 or compatible)** ‚Äì Controls the DC motor and interfaces with the sensors.
* **DC Motor** ‚Äì Drives the wheels for forward and reverse motion.
* **3 Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)** ‚Äì Positioned at:

  * Front (for detecting obstacles ahead),
  * Left side,
  * Right side.
* **Servo Motor** ‚Äì Rotates the vehicle to specific angles (130¬∞ or 60¬∞) to avoid obstacles.
* **External Power Supply** ‚Äì Powers the motors and servo (via Motor Shield).

üìè Sensor Placement and Logic

* **Front Ultrasonic Sensor:**

  * Constantly measures the distance to objects in front.
  * If an object is detected at less than **50 cm**, the vehicle stops, reverses briefly, and then **rotates** using the servo to find a clear path.
* **Left and Right Ultrasonic Sensors:**

  * Used to detect proximity to obstacles on the sides.
  * If either sensor detects an object **closer than 25 cm**, the vehicle triggers a **quick turn** in the opposite direction using the servo.

üîÅ Behavior Flow

1. The vehicle begins moving forward.
2. Continuously monitors distances from the three ultrasonic sensors.
3. If **front sensor < 50 cm**:

   * Stops,
   * Moves backward for a short duration,
   * Turns to **130¬∞** or **60¬∞** depending on the obstacle's location.
4. If **side sensor < 25 cm**:

   * Makes a faster and smaller-angle turn to avoid side collision.
5. Once a clear path is found, the servo reorients the wheels to the forward position, and the vehicle continues moving.

üß© Code Structure

The code is written in Arduino C++ and consists of:

* `setup()`: Initializes pins, sensor communication, and servo motor.
* `loop()`: Constantly monitors distances and makes decisions based on the threshold values.
* `measureDistance(triggerPin, echoPin)`: Calculates the distance using ultrasonic timing.
* `turnServo(angle)`: Turns the servo to rotate the robot.
* `moveForward()`, `moveBackward()`, `stopMotors()`: Control the DC motor via the Motor Shield.
